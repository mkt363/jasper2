<p>Are you a student currently studying digital marketing?</p>
<p>Or maybe you are interested in a going to <a href="http://undertheseo.com/top-digital-marketing-colleges">colleges with a digital marketing major</a>?</p>                   
<p>Whatever your path may be, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Check out these tips for succeeding as a digital marketing student!</p>


<h3>Do: Research careers</h3>
<p>Digital marketing careers can range from SEO Analyst to Copywriter to Social Media Manager to UX Designer.</p>
<p>And the list goes on and on…</p>
<p>There are a plethora of digital marketing careers and it can be hard to choose the right one!</p>
<p>Spend some time researching careers that interest you and write down your top 3 picks.</p>
<p>Now, when you go to classes on those topics, pay attention to how you feel when doing the course work.</p>
<p>Do you actually enjoy it? Or are you realize it’s not the best fit for your working style?</p>
<p>Luckily, college is a great place to find out what’s right for you.</p>

<h3>Do: Practice with family and friends</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to learn is by doing! I highly encourage you to take on side projects and get experience applying some of these principles.</p>
<p>Does your best friend’s mom have a website for her cupcake business? Practice running a search marketing campaign for her!</p>

<h3>Do: Learn outside of the classroom</h3>
<p>There are so many digital marketing topics that it can seem like the amount of knowledge is never ending.</p>
<p>For example, new SEO methods come out every year.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is impossible to learn EVERYTHING you need to know about digital marketing in one semester.</p>
<p>Go home and do your own reading about the current trends. Even after the class over, continue to expand your knowledge on the subjects.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about the subject, you’ll naturally do this anyway ;) </p>

<h3>Don’t: Limit yourself</h3>
<p>It is good to know early on what you want to center your career around. However, don’t put yourself into a box too soon.</p>
<p>While you are at school, use this opportunity to learn as much as you can! </p>
<p>The good thing about colleges with a digital marketing major is that you most likely have the chance to explore many different concentrations.</p>
<p>You never know what will happen in the future. The economy might change. Your dream job might be replaced by robots. Or your personal interests may just grow into something different as time goes on.</p>
<p>If you diversify your skillset, you’ll never have to worry about being stuck because you only know how to do one thing.</p>

<h3>Don’t: Be too general</h3>
<p>“Wait, what? You just *don’t* limit yourself? I’m getting very mixed signals here!”</p>
<p>I know what I said. But there is balance.</p>
<p>You don’t want your skill set to be so general that your average at everything and not really good at one thing.</p>
<p>Learn as much as you can <b>AND</b> find something you can specialize in.</p>
<p>When it comes to applying for internships and jobs, this is what will make you stand out from the rest.</p>

<h3>Avoid networking</h3>
<p>Many students studying digital marketing in college only start to think about networking once they are juniors or seniors. Don't wait.</p>
<p>Putting yourself out there to more experienced professionals can be daunting, and a lot of students will just flat out avoid it. Especially, those of the introverted variety.</p>
<p>However, the more you surround yourself with talented people, the more doors will open for you.</p>
<p>I’m talking job opportunities, projects, and even just learning more to better your own self a digital marketing student.</p>

<br>

<p>I hope you found these tips helpful and good luck on getting that degree!</p>
