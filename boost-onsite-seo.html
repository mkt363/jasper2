                    <p>Before I tell you how to improve your onsite SEO, you may want to know what it is first.</p>

<p>Onsite SEO is the practice of improving your search relevance by optimizing elements within the page.</p>
<p>By elements, I mean items on the page such as the title, site description, anchor text, URL, and even the content itself.</p>                   
<p>Optimizing these elements lets search engines and users interpret what your site is and what it is about, quickly.</p>
<p>Search engines use this information so that they may display relevant search results to users. This is important for users, because it helps them decide whether a site is worth clicking on or not, while also contributing to a better overall user experience.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the importance of it, let’s talk about how to give your onsite SEO a little boost!</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Content is extremely important when improving search optimization. The content that you write is ultimately what is going to give your readers value and keep them coming back for more.</p>
<p>Your top priority should be making sure users find your content relevant to what they searched for, as well as, improving the quality of the content itself.</p>

<p>Ways to provide quality content:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Organization</strong> - Structure your content in a way that flows naturally, is easy to navigate, and makes sense to users</li>
  <li><strong>Make it readable</strong> - Content should be easily understood and digested by its readers. Look over your content to make sure it is communicating its topic clearly. This <a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/">readability tool</a> allows a quick way to test the readability of your text.</li>
  <li><strong>Be unique</strong> - There are a million other websites out there in the vast internet universe. What makes yours different?</li>
  <li><strong>Reliability</strong> - Ensure that your content is an accurate and trustworthy source of information. This helps to establish authority with search engines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>Picking the right keywords can make or break your website.</p>
<p><em>“What are keywords and what is the big deal about them?”</em>, you may ask.</p>
<p>Keywords are essentially words or phrases that describe the topic of your content. These are what users type in when they are trying to find content relevant to those keywords.</p>
<p>You may have the most beautiful content ever written, but if it does not contain keywords that users are searching for, they may never see it. (Which by the way, is really bad for SEO!)</p>
<p>Therefore, you should center your website topics around words you know people are typing in when searching.</p>

<p>Good places for keywords to appear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Titles</li>
  <li>Headers</li>
  <li>URLs</li>
  <li>Body content</li>
</ul>

<p>Picking the right keywords can be tricky. If you pick phrases that are too popular, you will be competing against too many other websites to see great results. However, if you pick phrases that are too uncommon, it is rare that users are going to be searching for those at all. </p>
<p>It’s all about finding a balance between popular keywords and unique keywords to base your content around.</p>
<p>Luckily there are tools such as <a href="https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/#?modal_active=none">Google Keyword Planner</a> to help give you ideas.</p>

<h2>Meta Tags, Headers, and URLs, oh my!<h2>
<p>Don’t get too excited about content and keywords that you forget to optimize your HTML, as well.</p>
<p>Users may not be able to see your code, but search engines are always watching.</p>
<p>Meta tags are short bits of text within the code that describe what a site is about.</p>
<p>These give your website a better chance of being crawled and indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>Header tags include h1, h2, h3, etc. An h1 tag is usually reserved for the most important text on the page so this would be a good place to include keywords so that search engines and users can quickly see the relevance.</p>
<p>Title tags should also be keyword optimized. This is the text that appears in the browser tab at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Even elements such as site URL can affect SEO.</p>
<p>Between these two examples, which one would you guess conveys more relevance to the user:<br>
www.cars.com/a5BT4850_50Y or www.cars.com/how-to-buy-your-first-car
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Whether you know it or not, search engines, such as Google, are paying attention the links contained in your site.</p>
<p>Every link is essentially creating a trail for search engines that connects your content with other content.</p>
<p>Why is this important? </p>
<p>Search engines can use these connections to determine your sites trustworthiness, relevance, and quality.</p>
<p>Being connected to other reputable sites signals to search engines that your site is probably reputable as well, increasing its chances to land on that first page of search results.</p>

<p>Ways to optimize links:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal linking</strong> - Linking out to other pages of your own site signals a relationship between the pages and helps search engines to crawl pages that you want to index. This also encourages readers to stay on your site./li>
  <li><strong>External linking</strong> - Linking out to other sites within your page helps to connect your site with other reputable pages while also telling search engines that the content relates.</li>
  <li><strong>Anchor Text</strong> - This is the blue text that appears within a link. Give these meaningful and descriptive text vs something generic such as “click here”.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Factors that Contribute to Onsite SEO</h2>
<p>There are many other factors that contribute to on page SEO such as page loading speed, images, and mobile friendliness.</p>
<p>Together, all the aspects described in this post will contribute to the overall search relevance and user experience of a website.</p>
