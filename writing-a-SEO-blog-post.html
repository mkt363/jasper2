<p>So you want to start a blog but have no idea what goes into writing search engine optimized blog posts. Sure, you know how to write, but you are wondering how to apply search marketing topics to your content in order to reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>If that sounds anything like you then follow these tips on creating awesome, relevant, and optimized blog material!</p>                   

<h3 id="there-are-a-few-things-that-you-should-know-up-front">Before You Start</h3>
<p>Freeze! Step away from the keyboard. It is tempting to just jump right in and start writing but taking a brief moment to define some goals may be to your benefit.</p>                    
                    
<h4>Ask yourself the following questions:</h4>                    
                    
<ul>
  <li>What is the purpose of your text?</li>
  <li>How do you want the tone/voice of your text to come across?</li>
  <li>What do you want readers to do once they are done reading your post?</li>
</ul>
                   
<p>After answering these questions, keep the answers in mind when writing and structuring your content. This helps  to ensure that the end goal is kept in sight while creating content that will motivate your readers.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
                    
<h3>Titles and Headings</h3>                  
<p>A lot of people use the title of a post to decide if it is worth reading or not. It is the first thing you see, after all.</p>                   
<p>If your content is about the best secret vacation spots, then you better make sure your title alludes to that in some way.</p>
<p>Titles are usually designated inside of a title tag and an h1 tag. </p>
<p>A title is the text that appears up top in your browser tab. An h1 heading is the largest text that stands out on the page.</p>                   
<p>It is a good practice to use your target keyword within your title and main heading.</p>                    
<p>While your at it, optimize all your subheadings as wells (<h2>, <h3>, <h4>). This is a good way to tell search engines what your content is about.</p>                   
<p>Make sure you are careful about not overusing your keywords in every title as that is actually a bad thing in the eyes of search engines. </p>                    
<p>More on this later.</p> 
    
<h3>URL</h3>  
<p>Optimize your URL too!</p>                   
<p>Meta tags are short bits of text that describe what a site is about. </p>
 
<h3>Meta Tags</h3>  
<p>Optimize your URL too!</p>                   
<p>These do not show up in the actual content but search engines like Google are definitely paying attention to these.</p>
<p>Better meta tags = better chance of your page being crawled and indexed by search engines.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>  
<p>When it comes to writing blog posts, think about your user <em>needs</em>.</p>                   
<p>Strive to make your content valuable. The kind that will leave readers coming back for more.</p>
<p>Ensure the topics you write about are useful, relevant, and unique. And don’t forget to keep it up to date!</p>

<h3>Get To The Point</h3>  
<p>Long articles are not bad, as a matter of fact, they can be a really good thing in terms of SEO. However, make certain that you strip all the fluff and leave readers with what they actually come for.</p>                   
<p>Avoid rambling on and on throughout your post before finally getting to the main point.</p>
<p>If you're writing a particularly wordy blog post, use signal words such as “first”, “secondly”, “next”, “however”, and “nonetheless” to guide readers and make your text more scannable.</p>
 
<h3>Content Length</h3>  
<p>At the very minimum, a blog post should be at least 300 words. However, if you have a lot to say, you’ll most likely write much more than that anyway.</p>                   
<p>But how much is too much?</p>
<p>Well, like everything else in life, it depends.</p>
<p>The length of your blog post will depend on factors such as the topic, what the audience prefers, and more.</p>
<p>Even the goal of your writing matters. If you’re aiming for more comments and engagement, then a shorter post might be better. If your goal is to rank in Google, then a longer post may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Studies show that content around 2000 words tends to do pretty well.</p>    
<p>With more practice and experience, you will be able to monitor which pages on your site perform the best and determine guidelines from there.</p>                     
<p>As a general rule to start off with, try to make your posts somewhere between 750-2000 words.</p>    

<h3>Paragraph Formatting</h3>  
<p>Remember, no one wants to read a wall of text. </p>                   
<p>People have shorter attention spans than you may think.</p>
<p>Use small paragraphs that are 2-3 sentences long.</p>
<p>Avoid more than 25 words a sentence.</p>
<p>Spice up your paragraphs using different formatting options such as <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underline</u>, etc. This helps to highlight key points in your writing as well as visually breaking up your content for better readability.</p>

<h2>Keywords </h2>  
<p>Keywords, my friends, are super important. </p>                   
<p>Without the right keywords, you will not get very far.</p>
<p>You may think, “It’s just a couple of words and phrases right? What’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>Let me tell you that your content is extremely important, but if it does not include the words people are commonly searching for, then those people may never see it.</p>                   
<p>And, as you can guess, that’s bad for SEO.</p>
<p>Now you’re probably thinking, “Oh, so I should just look up some common keywords and just throw them into my writing. Simple!”</p>    
<p>Eh… I hate to break it to you, but you and 1 million other people have had that same thought. Meaning, you are all competing to rank for the same popular keywords. Meaning, your chances of taking that number one spot is not the best.</p>                   
<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>You may think, “It’s just a couple of words and phrases right? What’s the big deal?”</p>   

<h3>Keyword Research</h3>  
<p>Do your research!</p>                   
<p><strong>Keyword research</strong> is the method of finding the right keywords for your website to focus its marketing towards.</p>
<p>You don’t want to focus all your efforts on keywords that are too competitive to rank for but you also do not want to choose keywords nobody is searching for.</p>
<p>Try focusing on long-tail keywords which are three or four word phrases that are very specific to what you are marketing.</p>
<p>Like the difference between “cars” vs “electric cars Tesla 2018”</p>  
<p>If you need ideas for different keywords to use in your content, utilize tools such as <a href="https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/#?modal_active=none">Google Keyword Planner</a>. These useful resources are great for building strong, relevant keywords for your marketing content.</p>  
<p>Another way to get keyword ideas is to look at the related searches on Google for your keyword.</p>  
<img src="" alt="Related searches on Google for the keyword search marketing topics and optimization">

<h3>Keyword Density</h3>  
<p>The amount of times you use your keywords in your writing is something to pay attention to.</p>                   
<p>Keyword density is the percentage of times a keyword appears on the page in comparison to the total word count.</p>
<p>For example, if a keyword appeared 5 times on a page with 100 words, the keyword density would be 5%.</p>
<p>Try to keep your keyword density somewhere between 1-3%.</p>
<p>Any more than that and your content may come across as forced and unnatural.</p>  
<p>Not to mention you run the risk of being accused of stuffing keywords.</p>  
<p>Speaking of that, repeat after me: “<strong>I will not use keyword stuffing.</strong>”</p>  
<p>Now write that down on the board 10x times, spin around, and get that through your head.</p>                   
<p><strong>Keyword stuffing</strong> is the excessive use of keywords in your writing. </p>
<p>Search engines will interpret this as spam and will actually penalize you, making it even harder to come up in the ranks.</p>
<p>Avoid overuse of keywords at all costs.</p>   
    
<h2>Linking</h2>  
<h3>Backlinks</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your search rank is to have other sites link to your site. This is called building <strong>backlinks</strong>.</p>                   
<p>The more reputable the site linking to you, the better. This tells Google that your site can most likely be trusted because why else would reuputable sites be linking to you?</p>
<p>On the opposite end, having spammy or inappropriate sites linking to your page may hurt your search rank.</p>
<p>Some good sites to post your links to would be Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest, and more but definitely get creative!</p>                   
<p>These are called dofollow backlinks which allow Google to trace a link from another site, back to your site.</p>
<p>Also, put forth effort into creating content that people will want to link to!</p>

<h3>External and Internal Links</h3>
<p><strong>External linking<strong> is the practice of linking out to other sites within your page.</p>                   
<p>You may have already noticed that I have been linking to other similar sites about search marketing topics and optimization.</p>
<p>It may seem strange to be essentially creating backlinks for your competitors, but it all comes back to the user.</p>
<p>Giving your user reputable resources within your writing, will establish in their head that your site, itself, is reputable.</p>                   
<p><strong>Internal linking</strong> is the practice of linking to another page within your own site.</p>
<p>For example, before reading this article, you may want to check out this post explaining what search marketing is: <a href="http://undertheseo.com/what-is-search-marketing">What is Search Marketing Optimization Anyways?<a/></p>
<p>See what I did there? I just created an internal link to guide readers to view another one of my posts.</p>
<p>The value in doing this is that users will stay on your site and continue to read more of the relevant content you are offering to them. </p>
<p>It also signals a relationship between pages and helps Google crawl pages that you want to index.</p>
<p>With all links, make use of relevant anchor text. </p>
<p>Anchor text is the blue underlined text that signals to a reader that there is a link to click on. </p>

<h2>Learning Search Marketing Topics Doesn't Have To Be Hard!</h2>
                <p>Hey, I get it. There is a lot to learn and all of this information may seem overwhelming at first. Keyword strategies? Link building? AdWords? Onsite vs offsite SEO?
